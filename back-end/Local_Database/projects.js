      "Speak for the Trees Boston aims to improve the size and health of the urban forest in the greater Boston area, with a focus on under-served and under-canopied neighborhoods. They work with volunteers to inventory (collect data) trees, plant trees, and educate those about trees. C4C has built a tree stewardship application for SFTT that allows users to participate in conserving Boston's urban forest. Across Boston, hundreds of trees have been adopted and cared for.",

J-PAL works with the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development, which runs the country's largest summer youth employment program, to evaluate the impact of recommendation letters on participants’ educational and employment outcomes after the program. C4C is building a system that simplifies the creation, dissemination and completion of surveys that will be used to create unique letters of recommendation for each youth. Each youth will be sent their unique letter(s) of recommendation, which we hope will improve their educational and employment opportunities.",
